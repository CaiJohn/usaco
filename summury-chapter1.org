** Number Triangle:
   - Simple DP
   - compress the set of states
** Prime palindromes                                             :ATTENTION!:
   - The basic idea is brute force: enumerating all the
     possible integers and check whether they are both prime
     and palindromes
   - However, it can be much fast to directly generate
     palindromes
