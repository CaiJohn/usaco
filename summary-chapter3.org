* 3.1
** Agri-net
   - Minimum spanning tree, from the keywords: "minimize cost",
     "farm must connect to some other farm"
** TODO Score inflation
   - DP, unbounded knapsack problem
   - Compress space for states. It can be further reduced to an 1d array
** TODO Humble number
** Contact
   - for each length, search the sequence, sum up the number
     of all the patterns
   - The key point is to encode the pattern as an integer.
     To distinguish '00' and '000', we can make them as '100' and '1000'
   - The output printing
** Stamps
   - DP. Like another way of knapsack problem
   - Convert the problem to a DP problem: the value V can be constructed
     if and only if it requires <=K numbers of stamps
* 3.2
** Factorials
   - ?
** Stringsobits
   - The key is to realize that a sequence aa...a can be divided
     by the first bit, and those with 1 in the first bit is strictly
     greater than those with 0 in the first bit.
     [N,L,I] = if I>=len[N-1][L] then '0'+[N-1,L,I] else '1'+[N-1,L-1,I-len[N-1][L]
   - len[N][L] is the number of strings with N bits and at most L 1's.
     This can be calculated by DP. But do not be trapped by the idea of using DP,
     focus on the problem itself!
** Spinning Wheels
   - Simulation
   - Determine whether a pattern has searched before
   - Require accuracy in implementation
** Feed Ratios
   - Search. By enumerating the sum increasingly, get the smallest sum first
** Magic Squares
   - BFS, the number of all states is 8!
   - Use a hash table to check whether a state has been put into the queue
   - Cantor expansion! Or use base 8 number...
** Sweet Butter
   - Shortest path, sparse graph

* Methods
  - Focus on the problem itself! Don't be limited by the method used.(kimbits)
  - When it is BFS, always think what is the biggest queue possible; how to
    determine a state has been checked
* TODO
  - MST: two algorithms
  - disjoint set
  - printing: contact,
  - DP: inflate(further compress space), stamps, stringsobits
  - Cantor expansion!

* MST
  - Generic algorithm: maintain part of the MST
  - 1 theorem: light edge
  - Kruskal: forest to tree. 1. Disjoint set; 2. sort edge
  - The data structure for graph? Only the set of edges will be enough
  - matroid
